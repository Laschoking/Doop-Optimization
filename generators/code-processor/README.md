This is the Jimple parser/processor used by Doop when generating
results in SARIF form.

This can also be used by other code using Doop as a library, to
process Jimple code (`JimpleListenerImpl.parseJimple()`).

This subproject is built as a library but can also run as a standalone
binary (`fatJar` task).
