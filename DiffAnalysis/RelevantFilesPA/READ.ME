Each Program analysis only uses a subset of doop-fact relations to determine its outcomes.
Since not all relations in /facts/ are actually important for the merge, they rather blur the results.

Thus, manually, we define 2 files for each Program Analysis:
	1. the fact-relations used
	2. the important PA-Results (thus we avoid to compare helper relations, which are not relevant)
